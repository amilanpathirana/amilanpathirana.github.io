Generators and loads are the two main components of a power system. &#xA0;Loads are not constant. they vary throughout the day. It is a responsibility of the power grid operator to keep the loads and generators in balance. &#xA0;Power grid operator dispatches more generation if the demand gets high and removes generation if the demand get low. </p><p><strong>How do they know when to switch on and off the generators?</strong> The answer is the grid frequency. If the grid frequency gets low, power system operator dispatches more generation to bring the frequency back to 60hz. If the frequency of the grid goes high, power system operators reduce the generation to bring the frequency back down to 60 Hz.</p><p><strong>Why do the power system operators want to keep the frequency at 60 Hz?</strong> Because synchronous generators which used to generate power in large generating stations are magnetically coupled to the power network. If system frequency deviates from the generator operating frequency, generator can lose the synchronism with the power grid and can results in damages to the generator or automatic shutdown of the generator.</p><p>In Texas, the entity in charge of keeping the system frequency at 60 Hz is ERCOT, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. This is a non-profit corporation with board members representing basically every segment of the electricity market from generators to utilities to consumers. ERCOT&#x2019;s job is to oversee the entire system. They do not own or operate any facilities themselves, but they tell the operators of generation facilities when to start and stop running depending on the electrical demand.</p><p><strong>How Texas generate their electricity? </strong>Texas has a diverse portfolio of power generators. The largest segment of that is natural gas making up about half of the capacity. The second segment is wind turbines at about 30%. The rest of the generation fleet is made up mostly of coal powered plants, nuclear plants, and solar farms.</p><h3 id="on-february-7th">On February 7th</h3><p>2021 had already been a wintry one in many parts of Texas, but as the weekend drew near, the forecasts started to make clear that the next week would be extraordinarily cold.</p><h3 id="on-february-8th">On February 8th</h3><p>ERCOT had already started taking actions to get ready for very high expected electrical demands. ERCOT canceled/delayed approval for a large number of scheduled outages to make sure as much generators would be in service during the storm.</p><p>ERCOT worked with &#xA0;Texas Railroad Commission, which is in charge of the oil and gas industry, to increase the priority of delivering natural gas to power plants. They also worked with the U.S. Department of Energy to get permission for some power plants to temporarily exceed their emission limits from the EPA during peak needs for electricity.</p><h3 id="on-february-14th"><strong>On February 14th</strong></h3><p>The storm hits US.Essentially the entire southern U.S. had average temperatures 15 degrees Celsius below normal. All-time low temperature records were set in nearly every city across the region. It was the coldest many places had practically ever been.</p><p>Quarter of the generation was already out of service due to the weather a week before. About half of these outages were wind power and half natural gas generators.</p><p>Even with that lack of capacity, as night began to fall that Sunday, Everyone in the state was running their heaters to the max trying to stay warm. Texas hit its all-time winter peak electrical demand of nearly 70 GW.</p><p>As the evening continued, though, it became clear to ERCOT and utilities that the amount of electricity available on the grid may not be able to continue to meet the demand.</p><p>An advisory was issued that electrical reserves were low at around 11:30 PM.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Backpropagation]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Heart of training a neural network is the backpropagation algorithm that calculates the gradients of weights and biases with respect to the error.</p><p>Goal of calculating these gradients is to use gradient decent optimization method to find new weights and biases such that it minimizes the error.</p><p>Following video shows</p>]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/backpropagation/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">60694328107808500c7cfdc2</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Amila Pathirana]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 07 May 2020 04:43:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1545987796-200677ee1011?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fG5ldXJhbCUyMG5ldHdvcmt8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjE3NTExMzQ2&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1545987796-200677ee1011?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fG5ldXJhbCUyMG5ldHdvcmt8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjE3NTExMzQ2&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" alt="Backpropagation"><p>Heart of training a neural network is the backpropagation algorithm that calculates the gradients of weights and biases with respect to the error.</p><p>Goal of calculating these gradients is to use gradient decent optimization method to find new weights and biases such that it minimizes the error.</p><p>Following video shows how the backpropagation algorithm works for simplest of neural network.
